#### :globe_with_meridians: A Multiplatform Personal Portfolio with Dynamic Content Management, Multi-Language Support, and Automated Deployment

**M3Portfolio** is a comprehensive personal portfolio website developed using **Kobweb**, a framework built on top of Kotlin HTML. Designed as a multiplatform application, M3Portfolio serves both as a dynamic showcase for projects, certificates, skills, and detailed personal information, and as an administrative tool for managing website content.

This project features a server-side application connected to **MongoDB**, enabling secure and efficient data handling through RESTful API endpoints. It supports **user authentication**, allowing for differentiated access between regular users and admin. The static website component, written in Kotlin and running in the browser, interacts seamlessly with the backend to provide a responsive and interactive user experience.

**M3Portfolio** is hosted on **Render**, utilizing **Docker** for automated deployment. This setup allows for streamlined updates and management directly from the project's GitHub repository, ensuring that the latest changes are easily reflected in the live version.

### :star: Key Features:

- :lock: **User Authentication:** Secure login for both regular users and admin, with password encryption using SHA-256.
- :floppy_disk: **MongoDB Integration:** Robust database connectivity for storing and retrieving user data, project information, and content management.
- :arrows_clockwise: **API Endpoints:** Efficient data exchange between server and client using GET and POST calls.
- :memo: **Serialization/Deserialization:** Classes are serialized for data exchange and deserialized back for processing.
- :camera_flash: **Image Upload:** Supports image uploads, encoded as base64, ensuring compatibility and security.
- :iphone: **Responsive Design:** Adaptable layouts for various screen sizes (XL, LG, MD, SM), ensuring optimal viewing across devices.
- :earth_americas: **Language Support:** Multi-language support with a dropdown menu for switching between English and Arabic.
- :bulb: **Dark/Light Mode:** Offers both dark and light color schemes for user preference.
- :compass: **Navigation Panels:** Includes main and specific navigation panels to enhance user experience.
- :hammer: **Admin Dashboard:** Comprehensive admin control panel for adding, editing, and deleting content.
- :chart_with_upwards_trend: **Visitor Analytics:** Tracks new visitors and session history, providing insights into user engagement.
- :page_facing_up: **Live Resume Preview:** Direct integration with Google Drive for live resume viewing and downloading.
- :link: **Social Links:** Quick navigation to GitHub, LinkedIn, and other social profiles.
- :rocket: **Automated Deployment:** Utilizes Docker for containerization and Render for hosting, enabling automated deployment from GitHub.

**M3Portfolio** employs a structured approach using an MVVM-like architecture:

- **commonMain:** Houses shared models, utility functions, and navigation constants.
- **jsMain:** Contains all the UI components, styles, and client-side logic.
- **jvmMain:** Manages server-side functionality, including MongoDB interactions and API endpoints.

With animations, transitions, and efficient data handling, **M3Portfolio** not only provides a platform to showcase personal achievements but also empowers the user with control over their online presence. The deployment setup with Docker and Render ensures the project remains easily maintainable and scalable, making it a dynamic and versatile personal website solution.
